# Mars Viewer

#### A Mars Planetary Visualisation App

## About

This is a portfolio app to demonstrate my skills with data visualization.

It uses OpenSeadragon to render deep zoom image, and it contains its own tiler server to serve it.

It should be paired with the mars-tiler repository. You can find that here:

https://github.com/Tobio89/mars-tiler

Also check out the devlog file, where you can see the process I used to create this app - [Mars Viewer Devlog](devlog.md)

## Running the App

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the base directory
- Use `yarn` to install the dependencies
- Run the app with `yarn dev`
